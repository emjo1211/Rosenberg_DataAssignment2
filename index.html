					Chilly Weather & A Dip in Ridership For NYC Ferry in Winter Months

 					The New York City Ferry, a vital transportation link for the city, sees significant seasonal fluctuations in ridership. According to recent city data, (and as seen in the chart) boardings peak in summer months, with July reporting the highest usage at 930,615 passengers. Conversely, winter months reflect a sharp decline, with January and February totaling only 296,299 and 326,994 boardings, respectively.

 					2024 ridership data is from January through August. The Gothamist and the city Economic Development Corporation report 6.9 million rides so far in 2024. The ferries serve all buroughs and Govenor's Island on different routes. Fares are $4.50 but the Staten Island ferry is free and a great way to see the city.

					This steep drop-off highlights a challenge: the ferry is seen as underutilized during colder months, when harsh winds and cold temperatures discourage outdoor travel. Riders often face uncomfortable conditions on open decks or while waiting for ferries at terminals exposed to the elements.

					While the ferry provides scenic and efficient transit during warmer months, critics argue its limited ridership in winter raises questions about its cost-effectiveness. For year-round viability, the city may need to explore strategies to attract more riders during off-peak seasons or improve infrastructure to better accommodate winter conditions.
